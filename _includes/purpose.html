    <h3>I Love Puzzles!</h3>
    <p>Why am I learning to code?</p>
    <p>Puzzles make life interesting, right?  What I love about working with
       computers is that solving the problem is like a big puzzle.  Coding
       is a way for me to get lost in puzzles.</p>
    <p>This is my journey through the wonderful world of coding puzzles.
       I will be documenting my path while working on my creations.</p>

    <h3>My current puzzle...</h3>
    <p>My current profession is a teacher.  When I contemplate the future, one
    skill seems to be of the utmost importance: research.  My goal is to help
    people learn and do high-quality research.</p>
    <p>I want to create an app that helps people document their research.
    The app will record what you search, what websites you visit, and guide
    you through thinking about the topic by asking guiding questions.  The output
    will be a Google Doc with all this information typed out for you to
    easily share with others.</p>
