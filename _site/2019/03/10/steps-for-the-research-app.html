    <p>There is one very important task that learning to code brings to your attention: PLANNING!</p>

<p>The ability to visualize what you are creating is incredibly helpful.  We need something to head toward, something to give meaning to the steps we take.  Without this measure of meaning, we will easily get distracted and lost along the way.  But, this isn’t the only way planning is helpful.</p>

<p>Planning allows us to see what we know and what we need to learn.  If you can walk through a task step-by-step in your mind, then you can conclude you know it.  If you can only <em>see the destination</em> but don’t know the steps to take, then you can conclude that you need to learn it.</p>

<p>Below will be my current plan for the research-helping app.  I hope the planning process will give me concrete steps to take toward both the creation of the app and the learning of how to program.</p>

<h3 id="the-plan">The Plan</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Design the layout of the app
    <ul>
      <li>draw the layout (wireframe???)</li>
      <li>include specific html to use (eg) iframe, header, footer)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>does React/Vue have these components???</li>
      <li>Should I use React/Vue/Angular????</li>
      <li>Just CSS Grid for placement?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Code the layout
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid too much CSS at first - get a working prototype</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Key features of the app
    <ul>
      <li>Create Google doc of what the user has typed</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn Google doc API
      - Specific guiding questions to help with research</li>
      <li>What’s the goal of this research?
        <ul>
          <li>Full screen modal to help the user focus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What’s your current idea?
        <ul>
          <li>Full screen modal to help the user focus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What are some opposing ideas?</li>
      <li>What evidence supports your idea?</li>
      <li>What evidence supports the opposing ideas?</li>
      <li>What can you conclude based on the evidence?</li>
      <li>What are your next steps?
      - Highlight and copy text from the iframe browser and automatically include a citation when pasted</li>
      <li>citation APIs????
      - Continue working on past research</li>
      <li>Having a database of Users????</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is quite a mess.  That means my idea is not fully formed.  I know that drawing out the app and deeply explaining how things will work will be a useful step!  That will be my priority.</p>

<p>I hope seeing the starting, messy stages of creation will help inspire you to continue to take steps!</p>

<p>Keep Evolving!</p>
