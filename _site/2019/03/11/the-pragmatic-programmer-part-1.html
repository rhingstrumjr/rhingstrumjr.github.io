    <p class="date">
      Posted: 11 Mar 2019
    </p>

    <p>There has been one book that has been touted as a must read for programmers: <strong><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em></strong>.  I wanted to record my learning as I read it.  It will be documented here.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<h3 id="take-responsibility">Take responsibility</h3>
<p>There is only one person wholly responsible for me: ME!  In the eyes of a programmer, we must take full credit for our work.  This means taking the good <strong>and</strong> the bad.</p>

<p>If you run into problems, then think through possible paths to solve the problem.  People will accept mistakes as long as effort is shown to correct them.</p>

<h3 id="a-small-leak-leads-to-destruction">A small leak leads to destruction</h3>
<p>This idea hits home a bit hard.  I allow small things to build up.  We think it won’t matter.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One paper is okay to leave on the table.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Suddenly the entire table is covered…</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I’m too tired to put my clothes in the basket.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Suddenly the floor is covered with dirty clothes…</p>

<p>One allowance of entropy leads to greater and greater entropy.  Take the time to fix the little things.</p>

<h3 id="eyes-on-the-prize">Eyes on the prize</h3>
<p>We need to keep our eyes on the prize.  Don’t lose track of the big picture.  If we get too focused on the minutiae, then our project start to fall apart.</p>

<h3 id="keep-learning">Keep learning</h3>
<p>The authors encourage learning a new programming language each year.  That will keep you on your toes.  I like the idea of that.</p>

<p>The authors also encourage learning about <strong>normal</strong> people.  We must understand the user just as much as understanding programmers.</p>

<h3 id="communicate-with-the-audience">Communicate with the audience</h3>
<p>If you can’t help others see your vision, then you have no worthy vision.</p>

<p>Communicating is hard.  Take your time when crafting your message.  Understand your audience so you can communicate in a way they understand.</p>

<p>A good practice to help guide your communication is to develop an outline for your message.  We should never build without a basic outline.  That goes for when we code to when we communicate.  After all, coding is just communicating with a computer…</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<h3 id="dry-off-your-code">DRY off your code</h3>
<p>DRY stands for <strong>D</strong>on’t <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself.  The problem with repeating code is when we go back to debug it.  Fixing one error is okay.  Fixing 2 can be manageable.  But once we have to find an error in 3 or more different sections, the frustration level will be sky high!  Therefore, stay <strong>DRY</strong>!</p>

<p>Keep Evolving!</p>
