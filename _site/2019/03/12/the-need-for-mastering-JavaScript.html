    <h1 class="blog">The Need For Mastering Javascript</h1>

    <p class="date">
      Posted: 12 Mar 2019
    </p>

    <p>I’ve realized that I really need to understand basic JavaScript.  However, doing tutorials isn’t enough for me.  I’ve found two potentially useful resources:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wes Bos’ <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30</a> course</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com">CodeWars</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="javascript30">JavaScript30</h3>
<p>Projects help you learn.  What I love about this idea is how it incorporates all of the basics of web development.  Wes Bos has designed projects which will also keep your HTML and CSS skills sharp.  (I guess that’s only true if you decide to make the project look good…)</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the projects I’m looking forward to.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drum Kit</li>
  <li>Ajax Type Ahead (I’ve never used Ajax!)</li>
  <li>HTML5 Canvas</li>
  <li>Slide in on Scroll</li>
  <li>Whack-a-mole!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll be exposing myself to various JavaScript methods and building fun things along the way!</p>

<h3 id="codewars">CodeWars</h3>
<p>CodeWars is a website that has the feeling of being a martial arts dojo.  You must pass a test to become a member.  Then, you train by completing various coding challenges.</p>

<p>The challenges can be tough!  I had one that took me 2 hours to complete, but the learning was worth it.  So far, most of the challenges I’ve had involved manipulating strings and arrays.  Understanding how to work with those data types will be valuable anywhere I go.</p>

<p>I’ve had an idea of sharing my thought process of the puzzles while I solve it and then breaking down the <strong>best practice</strong> answer.  It has amazed me how my answer can be 10+ lines of code and see that the same result could be accomplished as a oneliner.</p>

<p>I hope these resources help you in your journey to understanding JavaScript!</p>

<p>Keep Evolving!</p>
