&lt;p&gt;Dave Geddes created a game called &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies&quot;&gt;Flexbox Zombies&lt;/a&gt;.  It walks you through all of the features of Flexbox while killing off zombie hordes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first step towards anything is to create it first in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea may have come from Steven Covey.  I don’t remember.  Maybe one day I will look it up.  Let’s get to the heart of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to create an app to help guide people in research.  The app will track the websites for the user.  If the user finds something useful, it will then place a note with a link to the website.  Also, there will be guiding questions to help eliminate cognitive errors in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app will then create a Google Doc with all the notes and links so the research can be easily shared and reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a general idea of the layout.  I want a sidebar on the left with buttons for the guiding questions.  I want a menu at the top where the user can sign in and start or continue research.  I want a place for text so the user can see what will be transferred to the Google Doc.  I also want a browser window for the user to use as research.  Below the browser window will be buttons to move the highlighted words in the mini-browser over to the text field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream is solidifying.  Now, I need to create what I can to expose the next challenges!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I heard this piece of advice once.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bananas</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/02/bananas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bananas" /><published>2019-02-02T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/02/02/bananas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/02/02/bananas.html">&lt;p&gt;A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kiwifruit</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/08/22/kiwifruit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kiwifruit" /><published>2018-08-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-08-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/08/22/kiwifruit</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/08/22/kiwifruit.html">&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible

&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</summary></entry></feed>
