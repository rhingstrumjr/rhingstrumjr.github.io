However, doing tutorials isn’t enough for me.  I’ve found two potentially useful resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wes Bos’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript30.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript30&lt;/a&gt; course&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codewars.com&quot;&gt;CodeWars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascript30&quot;&gt;JavaScript30&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects help you learn.  What I love about this idea is how it incorporates all of the basics of web development.  Wes Bos has designed projects which will also keep your HTML and CSS skills sharp.  (I guess that’s only true if you decide to make the project look good…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of the projects I’m looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drum Kit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ajax Type Ahead (I’ve never used Ajax!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTML5 Canvas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slide in on Scroll&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whack-a-mole!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be exposing myself to various JavaScript methods and building fun things along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;codewars&quot;&gt;CodeWars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CodeWars is a website that has the feeling of being a martial arts dojo.  You must pass a test to become a member.  Then, you train by completing various coding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges can be tough!  I had one that took me 2 hours to complete, but the learning was worth it.  So far, most of the challenges I’ve had involved manipulating strings and arrays.  Understanding how to work with those data types will be valuable anywhere I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had an idea of sharing my thought process of the puzzles while I solve it and then breaking down the &lt;strong&gt;best practice&lt;/strong&gt; answer.  It has amazed me how my answer can be 10+ lines of code and see that the same result could be accomplished as a oneliner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope these resources help you in your journey to understanding JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to record my learning as I read it.  It will be documented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-responsibility&quot;&gt;Take responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one person wholly responsible for me: ME!  In the eyes of a programmer, we must take full credit for our work.  This means taking the good &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run into problems, then think through possible paths to solve the problem.  People will accept mistakes as long as effort is shown to correct them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-small-leak-leads-to-destruction&quot;&gt;A small leak leads to destruction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea hits home a bit hard.  I allow small things to build up.  We think it won’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One paper is okay to leave on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the entire table is covered…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m too tired to put my clothes in the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the floor is covered with dirty clothes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One allowance of entropy leads to greater and greater entropy.  Take the time to fix the little things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eyes-on-the-prize&quot;&gt;Eyes on the prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep our eyes on the prize.  Don’t lose track of the big picture.  If we get too focused on the minutiae, then our project start to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-learning&quot;&gt;Keep learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors encourage learning a new programming language each year.  That will keep you on your toes.  I like the idea of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also encourage learning about &lt;strong&gt;normal&lt;/strong&gt; people.  We must understand the user just as much as understanding programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communicate-with-the-audience&quot;&gt;Communicate with the audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t help others see your vision, then you have no worthy vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating is hard.  Take your time when crafting your message.  Understand your audience so you can communicate in a way they understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good practice to help guide your communication is to develop an outline for your message.  We should never build without a basic outline.  That goes for when we code to when we communicate.  After all, coding is just communicating with a computer…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-2&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dry-off-your-code&quot;&gt;DRY off your code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRY stands for &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;on’t &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;epeat &lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;ourself.  The problem with repeating code is when we go back to debug it.  Fixing one error is okay.  Fixing 2 can be manageable.  But once we have to find an error in 3 or more different sections, the frustration level will be sky high!  Therefore, stay &lt;strong&gt;DRY&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototype-prototype-prototype&quot;&gt;Prototype, prototype, prototype…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start off this section by saying the authors separate ideas that I find to be very similar.  They have three different ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracer Programs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracer programs are like tracer bullets.  You shoot and see if something works.  Then, you keep building off that design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototyping is when you build something quick to test it while knowing you won’t actually use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple languages is a shorthand way of writing out a program without a computer language’s specific syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, all of these involve building and testing over and over.  I’m reminded of a psychology study where kindergartners were better at solving a problem than graduate students.  The task was to build a tower out of random materials.  The key component of success for the kindergartners was their constant build-and-test mentality.  If the tower stood, then it was a success.  If it fell, then they rebuilt it.  On the other hand, the graduate students spent so much time planning, they missed out on the ability to test and reevaluate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to keep a mind like the kindergartners.  Don’t become discouraged if your idea falls apart.  Learn from it and build again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to visualize what you are creating is incredibly helpful.  We need something to head toward, something to give meaning to the steps we take.  Without this measure of meaning, we will easily get distracted and lost along the way.  But, this isn’t the only way planning is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning allows us to see what we know and what we need to learn.  If you can walk through a task step-by-step in your mind, then you can conclude you know it.  If you can only &lt;em&gt;see the destination&lt;/em&gt; but don’t know the steps to take, then you can conclude that you need to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below will be my current plan for the research-helping app.  I hope the planning process will give me concrete steps to take toward both the creation of the app and the learning of how to program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design the layout of the app
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;draw the layout (wireframe???)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;include specific html to use (eg) iframe, header, footer)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;does React/Vue have these components???&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Should I use React/Vue/Angular????&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Just CSS Grid for placement?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code the layout
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Avoid too much CSS at first - get a working prototype&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key features of the app
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Create Google doc of what the user has typed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Learn Google doc API
      - Specific guiding questions to help with research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What’s the goal of this research?
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Full screen modal to help the user focus&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What’s your current idea?
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Full screen modal to help the user focus&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What are some opposing ideas?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What evidence supports your idea?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What evidence supports the opposing ideas?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What can you conclude based on the evidence?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What are your next steps?
      - Highlight and copy text from the iframe browser and automatically include a citation when pasted&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;citation APIs????
      - Continue working on past research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Having a database of Users????&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite a mess.  That means my idea is not fully formed.  I know that drawing out the app and deeply explaining how things will work will be a useful step!  That will be my priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope seeing the starting, messy stages of creation will help inspire you to continue to take steps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first step towards anything is to create it first in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea may have come from Steven Covey.  I don’t remember.  Maybe one day I will look it up.  Let’s get to the heart of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to create an app to help guide people in research.  The app will track the websites for the user.  If the user finds something useful, it will then place a note with a link to the website.  Also, there will be guiding questions to help eliminate cognitive errors in judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app will then create a Google Doc with all the notes and links so the research can be easily shared and reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a general idea of the layout.  I want a sidebar on the left with buttons for the guiding questions.  I want a menu at the top where the user can sign in and start or continue research.  I want a place for text so the user can see what will be transferred to the Google Doc.  I also want a browser window for the user to use as research.  Below the browser window will be buttons to move the highlighted words in the mini-browser over to the text field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dream is solidifying.  Now, I need to create what I can to expose the next challenges!&lt;/p&gt;
