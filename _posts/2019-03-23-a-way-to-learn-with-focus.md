While looking for information, you will come across WAY more than is needed for your project.  I've found myself getting distracted multiple times.  I've spent hours doing coding challenges that were not heading toward the metaphorical peak of my project.

The question became, "How can I redirect myself?"

I needed a compass.  I found a useful question to ask yourself repeatedly.  Here it is:

> How does what I just learned help me for my project?

The question is simple.  It also helps give us feedback on whether we are heading down a helpful path or not.  

Adding a second question will help us feel as though the time wasn't wasted.  Here's the second question:

> In what cases might this information be useful?

Maybe you know someone that could use the information.  Maybe you will be in one of the cases you mention later.  But, don't get totally distracted from your project accidently!

Keep Evolving!
