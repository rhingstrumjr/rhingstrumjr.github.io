There has been one book that has been touted as a must read for programmers: ___The Pragmatic Programmer___.  I wanted to record my learning as I read it.  It will be documented here.

## Chapter 1

### Take responsibility
There is only one person wholly responsible for me: ME!  In the eyes of a programmer, we must take full credit for our work.  This means taking the good **and** the bad.  

If you run into problems, then think through possible paths to solve the problem.  People will accept mistakes as long as effort is shown to correct them.

### A small leak leads to destruction
This idea hits home a bit hard.  I allow small things to build up.  We think it won't matter.  
>>One paper is okay to leave on the table.

Suddenly the entire table is covered...
>>I'm too tired to put my clothes in the basket.

Suddenly the floor is covered with dirty clothes...

One allowance of entropy leads to greater and greater entropy.  Take the time to fix the little things.  

### Eyes on the prize
We need to keep our eyes on the prize.  Don't lose track of the big picture.  If we get too focused on the minutiae, then our project start to fall apart.

### Keep learning
The authors encourage learning a new programming language each year.  That will keep you on your toes.  I like the idea of that.  

The authors also encourage learning about __normal__ people.  We must understand the user just as much as understanding programmers.

### Communicate with the audience
If you can't help others see your vision, then you have no worthy vision.  

Communicating is hard.  Take your time when crafting your message.  Understand your audience so you can communicate in a way they understand.  

A good practice to help guide your communication is to develop an outline for your message.  We should never build without a basic outline.  That goes for when we code to when we communicate.  After all, coding is just communicating with a computer...

## Chapter 2
### DRY off your code
DRY stands for **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself.  The problem with repeating code is when we go back to debug it.  Fixing one error is okay.  Fixing 2 can be manageable.  But once we have to find an error in 3 or more different sections, the frustration level will be sky high!  Therefore, stay **DRY**!

### Prototype, prototype, prototype...
I want to start off this section by saying the authors separate ideas that I find to be very similar.  They have three different ideas:
1. Tracer Programs
2. Prototyping
3. Simple languages

Tracer programs are like tracer bullets.  You shoot and see if something works.  Then, you keep building off that design.

Prototyping is when you build something quick to test it while knowing you won't actually use it.

Simple languages is a shorthand way of writing out a program without a computer language's specific syntax.

To me, all of these involve building and testing over and over.  I'm reminded of a psychology study where kindergartners were better at solving a problem than graduate students.  The task was to build a tower out of random materials.  The key component of success for the kindergartners was their constant build-and-test mentality.  If the tower stood, then it was a success.  If it fell, then they rebuilt it.  On the other hand, the graduate students spent so much time planning, they missed out on the ability to test and reevaluate.  

We need to keep a mind like the kindergartners.  Don't become discouraged if your idea falls apart.  Learn from it and build again!

## Chapter 3
### Learn your tools
If you don't know how to properly use your tools, then you will never become a true master.  As programmers, we must learn the basic tools.  For example, get to know your code editor and shell.  If you master those by learning the shortcuts, then your productivity will skyrocket!

The best example I have of this is from my Udacity course.  The example was a simple task: move pictures to a new directory.  If I was using the GUI, I could get it done in about a minute.  However, using the shell, I was able to get all the files moved in under 10 seconds.  Typing one line is far faster than creating a new folder, selecting the files, and dragging the files to the new folder using a mouse.  

Keep Evolving!
