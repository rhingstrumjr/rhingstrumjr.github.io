I heard this piece of advice once.

>The first step towards anything is to create it first in your brain.  

The idea may have come from Steven Covey.  I don't remember.  Maybe one day I will look it up.  Let's get to the heart of the matter.

I want to create an app to help guide people in research.  The app will track the websites for the user.  If the user finds something useful, it will then place a note with a link to the website.  Also, there will be guiding questions to help eliminate cognitive errors in judgment.

The app will then create a Google Doc with all the notes and links so the research can be easily shared and reviewed.

I have a general idea of the layout.  I want a sidebar on the left with buttons for the guiding questions.  I want a menu at the top where the user can sign in and start or continue research.  I want a place for text so the user can see what will be transferred to the Google Doc.  I also want a browser window for the user to use as research.  Below the browser window will be buttons to move the highlighted words in the mini-browser over to the text field.

The dream is solidifying.  Now, I need to create what I can to expose the next challenges!

Keep Evolving!
